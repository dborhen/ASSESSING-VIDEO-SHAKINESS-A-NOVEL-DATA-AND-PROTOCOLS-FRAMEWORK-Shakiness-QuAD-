ASSESSING VIDEO SHAKINESS: A NOVEL DATA AND PROTOCOLS FRAMEWORK
## Description:
This is a repository for the  Shakiness-QuAD dataset proposed in the paper ["ASSESSING VIDEO SHAKINESS: A NOVEL DATA AND PROTOCOLS FRAMEWORK"] (accepted be ICIP 2024 conference).

The Shakiness-QuAD Dataset includes 30 shaky videos covering relevant categories such as climbing, driving, large parallax, rotation, running, and walking, with different scenes and levels of shakiness.
All videos have resolutions of 1920Ã—1080 pixels, and are provided in raw mpeg4 format. The frame rates of the 30 videos range from 29.93 to 30 frames per second, and all of the videos are of 7 seconds duration. 
A pairwise comparison (PWC) was conducted, involving human observers who evaluated the perceived quality of shaky videos, and the results have been converted into quality scores using the Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD)
scaling method.
